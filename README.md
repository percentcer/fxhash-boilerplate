# fxhash-boilerplate
Some basic setups for fxhash generators

# Run
Just open the index.html in browser

# Local testing
Recommend serving the directory with `python -m http.server` and then using the excellent [Live Reload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/live-reload/jcejoncdonagmfohjcdgohnmecaipidc?hl=en) plugin.

# fx(hash) testing
Navigate to a subdirectory and create a zip of all the files there. Do not zip the directory itself. index.html should **not** be in a subdirectory, it should be at the root of the zip!
Drop the zip onto the button at https://www.fxhash.xyz/sandbox
